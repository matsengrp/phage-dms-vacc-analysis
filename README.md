## Abstract

Control of the COVID-19 pandemic will rely on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-elicited antibodies to protect against emerging and future variants; a more complete description of the differential humoral responses from infection or vaccination is needed. Here we comprehensively profiled the linear epitopes and pathways of escape for Spike-specific antibodies from individuals either enrolled in a phase 1 clinical trial of the mRNA-1273 Moderna vaccine (n=49) or enrolled in a Seattle-based study of people with diverse SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination status (n=60). Four epitopes accounted for most of the variance between samples: N-terminal domain (NTD), C-terminal domain (CTD), fusion peptide (FP), and heptad repeat 2 (HR2) epitopes. Binding to the FP and HR2 epitopes alone was associated with mild infection, whereas those with severe infection or vaccination had antibodies that bound to all four epitopes. Epitope binding appeared to change over time after vaccination, but other covariates such as mRNA vaccine dose, vaccine type (Pfizer BNT162b2 or Moderna mRNA-1273), or participant age did not appear to affect antibody binding to these epitopes. Vaccination induced a strong, uniform escape profile in the NTD, CTD, and HR2 regions, whereas infection elicited a strong response in the FP region with an antibody escape profile that was maintained after vaccination. Overall, vaccination led to a greater number of epitopes targeted across Spike and induced a uniform escape profile across individuals in many cases. These findings have implications for the selection of SARS-CoV-2 escape mutations on a population level.
